## Acknowledgements

This project would not have been possible without the support and contributions of many individuals and tools. We would like to express our gratitude to the Break Through Tech AI studio program at UCLA for providing the opportunity and resources to bring this project to life. Special thanks to our Challenge Advisor, Joe Webington from Snowflake, for his guidance and expertise throughout the project. 

Our dedicated team – Ella Chung (UCI), Eric Lu (UCLA), Evelyn Xu (UCLA), Prachi Heda (UCSD), and Kaleo Cao (UCSD) –worked collaboratively to achieve our goals and deliver meaningful outcomes.

We want to give a shout out to the tools and libraries that were essential to making this project happen, including Snowflake, scikit-learn (Snowflake.ml.modeling library), SQL, Streamlit, Snowflake Marketplace, and Snowflake Notebook, which provided the technical foundation for our analyses and interactive tools.

Thank you to everyone who contributed to this project's success.
